            <p>Pointing at the BNP, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told parliament today (November 3, 2022) that those who come in power in an illegal way cannot give democracy and protect human rights.

                "Now we've to hear statements on democracy and human rights. But those who come in power through martial law, they can't give democracy. Those who come in power in an illegal way, violating the constitution can't give democracy. How can they protect human rights?" she questioned.</p>
